# Modified-Kaprekar-Numbers-algo
This code remedies the Kaprekar Numbers problem by finding altered Kaprekar numbers in a specified range. The code tests every number by squaring it, dividing the square into segments, and checking if the sum of segments is the same as the original number, dealing with edge cases such as leading zeros and one-digit numbers.
